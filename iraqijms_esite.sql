The immune responses play a pivotal role in limiting cystic larval development.\r\nObjective:To investigate the immunopathological effects of Fasciola hepatica antigens (FHAgs) and hydatid cyst fluid antigens (HCFAgs) on the immune response against hydatidosis in mice.\r\nMethods:	One hundred mice were divided into 5 groups; the 1st three were immunized subcutaneously with 0.2 ml of HCFAgs, FHAgs and mixed antigen (MAg = HCFAgs+FHAgs), respectively. The last two regarded as control groups. On day 27 post immunization, the skin test was done for the 1st four groups. On day 30, half the animals of each group were scarified to perform E-rosette test, agar gel diffusion (AGD), and ELISA test. The rest of the mice with the 5th group were challenged with 2000 viable protoscolex / mouse. After 3 months, they were scarified for gross and histopathological examination.\r\nResults:The immunized group with MAg was hypersensitive prior to challenge the skin test, while E-rosette test indicated the highest ratio of active lymphocytes before and after challenge in comparison with other groups. The AGD test showed severe reaction between the sera of mice immunized with MAg against the FHAgs against HCFAg and between sera of immunized group with FHAgs against HCFAg and vice versa. The highest level of antibodies was recorded in the immunized group with MAg. Histopathological examination for the internal organs of immunized groups revealed granulomatous lesions, reduction in the number of cysts with lymphocytic hyperplasia and presence of degenerative protoscolices.

A lot of studies suggested certain GBS clinical and preclinical features anticipate and predicate the neuromuscular respiratory failure and can accurately assess the progression to mechanical ventilation; bulbar muscles involvement, severity of weakness of upper and lower limbs, bilateral facial muscles involvement and autonomic nervous system involvement were the main features associated with progression to mechanical ventilation.\r\nObjectives:To assess demographic, clinical and para clinical features and their relation with the progression of GBS to respiratory failure.\r\nMethods:	Clinical and paraclinical predictors of impending respiratory involvement and requirement for mechanical ventilation were studied in 40 GBS patients aged 12-57 years (28 males and 12 females).\r\nResults:Ten (6 female/4 male) patients (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and received mechanical ventilation. Younger age, female gender and rapid disease progression in first 3 days were associated with respiratory involvement and subsequent ventilation. Bulbar weakness, bilateral facial palsy, poor digit counting (<10/1 breath) were the strongest indicators of impending respiratory failure. In combination they were found in 90% of ventilated patients. Dense weakness (power grade ≤2), weak neck flexion and axonal electromyography also showed significant risk for mechanical ventilation. Other parameters (autonomic dysfunction, antecedent gastrointestinal and respiratory illness, earlier upper limbs weakness and pain) showed no statistical significance in our study\r\nConclusion:Respiratory failure in the course of GBS can to some extent, predicted depending on clinical information. Respiratory failure was associated with younger age, female gender, rapid progressive weakness, bulbar weakness. Facial weakness.

The diagnosis is mostly radiological, yet, the extent of neural impairment cannot be expressed by radiological means. It is hypothesized that somatosensory evoked potential indicate a nerve root involvement complementary to the neurological examination.\r\nObjectives:To evaluate the usefulness of different parameters of mixed somatosensory evoked potential in the diagnosis of lumbosacral stenosis.\r\nMethods:	Thirty five patients with Lumbosacral stenosis, clinically and radiologically confirmed by MRI examination and 20 normal individuals were enrolled in the study. Mixed-somatosensory evoked potentials of tibial nerve was done using subdermal monopolar needle electrodes at 4 channels; cortical, lower thoracic, lumbar and popliteal. From these channels negative waves (N45, N25, N20 and N10) were studied for both latency and amplitude, besides the central sensory conduction time which represents inter-peak latency between N25 and N45.\r\nResults:The cutoff values of N25, N45 and N20 wave latencies presented highly significant differences between affected sides and controls; with the highest difference given by N25 wave (P< 0.0001).

The mixed somatosensory wave amplitude cutoff values showed equivocal results about the sensitivity and specificity percentages.\r\nConclusions:Mixed somatosensory evoked potential study can be used as a supplementary test in the diagnosis of Lumbosacral stenosis. N25 wave has the highest diagnostic yield due to having the highest sensitivity and specificity.

Bacterial translocation has been long been considered as a possible direct cause of sepsis when under certain conditions bacteria cross the intestinal barrier, enter the systemic circulation and cause ageneralised inflammatory response syndrome. While this is an attractive hypothesis, which finds support from experimental models, evidence from clinical studies is equivocal in confirming that bacterial translocation is the primary cause of sepsis. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms by which gut bacteria gain entry to the systemic circulation are not well defined.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a pharmaceutical drug and nutritional supplement represents the rapidly absorbed form of the amino acid L-cysteine and acts as antioxidant.\r\nObjective:The current study aims to investigate the protective role of N-acetylcysteine administration against 5-FU induced pulmonary toxicity in albino rats.\r\nMethods:	The study was conducted on 18 healthy adult female and male Wistar albino rats which were randomly selected and equally distributed into three groups of 6 rats for each. Group I served as a control group. Group II received 5-FU (20 mg in 2ml normal saline per kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection for 7 consecutive days. Group III received intraperitoneal injections of N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) 24 hour prior to each intraperitoneal injections of 5-FU for 7 consecutive days. The specimens of lung tissue of the three groups were extracted and prepared for light microscopic examination. The tissue sections were stained with Harris Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain and with Masson\'s trichrome stain.\r\nResults:Structural changes were observed in Group II (5-FU recipient group compared to Group I (control group)including emphysematous dilatation of the alveoli, proliferation of  BALT (bronchus associated lymphatic tissue), thickening of alveolar walls with mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltration, in addition to congestion and hemorrhage of pulmonary interstitium. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine effectively reduces the changes induced by 5-FUon the lung and reverts the abnormal pulmonary structure to become nearer to the norms.\r\nConclusion:Treatment with N-acetylcysteine prior to 5-fluorouracil effectively attenuated 5-FU induced pulmonary damage and reverted the abnormal structural changes to near normal.

Many suggest a role of WT1 for angiogenesis in hematological malignancies, WT1 is also expressed in a large variety of tumour blood vessels, and some suggests that it might be a general marker for angiogenesis.\r\nObjective:To assess the role of WT1 protein expression immunohistochemically in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and to determine whether there is a correlation between WT1 protein expression and CD31 expression as a marker of angiogenesis.\r\nMethods:This study involved 16 cases of newly diagnosed CML. In addition, 20 age matched control cases were involved having no apparent bone marrow pathology. Immunohistochemistry was done on bone marrow biopsies using Anti-WT1 and Anti-CD31 Monoclonal antibodies.\r\nResults:There was a significant increase in WT1 protein expression in CML cases, as well as an increase in CD31 expression; however, there was no significant correlation between WT1 expression and hematological parameters (WBC count, platelets count, PCV level, and peripheral blood blast %)  and CD31 expression.\r\nConclusion:This study showed that WT1 is overexpressed in CML patients, while it was undetected in controls, thus we may propose that it maybe used as an auxiliary marker for the disease.

Sometimes it is possible to sacrifice only part of the facial nerve and this termed \"semiconservative parotidectomy\". The commonest operation performed is superficial conservative parotidectomy, which is removal of the parotid superficial to the facial nerve with nerve preservation. A total conservative parotidectomy was performed only if clearly indicated by the pathological condition, since the complete freeing of the facial nerve in this operation increases the incidence of nerve paralysis.\r\nObjective:To demonstrate under what circumstances is the surgeon likely to be called upon to sacrifice the facial nerve deliberately, and mentioning what be done to reduce the risk of functional facial paralysis following conservative parotidectomy.\r\nMethods:The material comprises 30 cases of parotidectomy of all types. We analysed the incidence and degree of functional facial paralysis following conservative parotidectomy and also we reported some experimental work attempting to elucidate its etiology. We classify the degree of facial nerve paralysis to grade I, absent or slight, grade II moderate, grade III complete.\r\nResults:We did superficial parotidectomies for 22 cases, 19 had grade I, two had grade II and only one had grade III facial nerve paralysis.

The results were evaluated according to the following criteria; Good: where the ptotic lid lies within 1 mm of normal lid position (1 mm below superior limbus) in primary gaze position. Moderate: postoperative lid position drooped more than 1 mm of normal lid position but maintained above the pupil. Poor: post operative lid position drooped to obscure the visual axis in primary gaze position.\r\nResults :20 cases (80%) were having good results, 5 cases had moderate results (20%). There were no poor results. There was no need for additional tarsectomy in our cases.\r\nConclusion: Whitnall sling procedure is a good choice for cases lying in the overlap zone between it and the frontalis sling procedure whenever the surgical indications and procedure of choice were concerned.\r\nKeywords: blepharoptosis, congenital lid ptosis, whitnal sling\r\n', '', 'upload/pdf/iraqijms5702ce0f95ce1.pdf', '', 0, '', 1, 57, 0, '2016-04-04 20:26:55', 0, 0, 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Jafer H Zainy, Abd Alkhalik El Qurishi, Jaafer A Al-Ugaily ', 0),

Among numerous modifications of the procedure is using synthetic sling material to decrease surgical morbidity and increase long-term success.\r\nObjective:To present the results of pubovaginal sling with a polypropylene mesh in women with SUI.\r\nMethods:	We studied 12 consecutive patients who underwent PVS procedure using polypropylene mesh for SUI between January 2008 and April 2009.  Stress urinary incontinence was demonstrated by positive cough test, filling cystometry. Urethral hyper mobility was demonstrated with straining cotton swab (≥ 30◦), with different grades of vaginal wall prolapse. Urodynamic study was not performed. All these patients were treated with pubovaginal sling (PVS) with a low-cost polypropylene mesh confectioned by the surgeon. The sling was placed at the level of the proximal half of the urethra and tied with adequate tension, but not obstructing the bladder outlet. Postoperatively, the patients were evaluated at 6-month with a symptom questionnaire, physical examination, and postvoid residual volume determination.  Demographic criteria, complications during surgery and post operative period, and subjective cure rate at three months were assessed.\r\nResults:Twelve patients with mean age of 55.5 years and median parity of 4 years underwent bladder neck sling surgery using polypropylene mesh. Body weight range was 45-68 kg. No intraoperative or major postoperative complications were reported. Mean duration of surgery was 65.5 minutes (60-120 minutes). Concomitant procedures were performed, including cystocele repair (n= 10) rectocele repair (n=11). Mean duration of hospital stay was 2 days (1-5 days). Ten patients had complete cure of SUI, one patient had   significant decrease in the severity of stress urinary incontinence.

The alteration in trace elements could have deleterious effects on the health of the diabetic patients. Magnesium (Mg) is an important factor for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and good evidence suggests the presence of an important role for hypomagnesaemia in insulin resistance and metabolic control.\r\nObjective: To evaluate the relation of hypomagnesaemia with insulin resistance (IR), and glycemic control in obese and non obese diabetic people.\r\nMethods: The study included 65 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM) who were all on oral hypoglycemic drugs only. They were divided according to their body mass index (BMI) and the presence or absence urinary protein, into three groups. The results were compared with those of another 52 normal controls grouped on the same bases.\r\nFasting venous blood specimens were aspirated for the measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by A1c variant reader, glucose, urea, creatinine, protein and albumin by routine enzymatic chemical and colorimetric methods, insulin by immuno-enzymometric assay and magnesium by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, while Mg ions and Quicki test (for IR) were estimated by calculations. Morning urine specimens from each subject were examined for the presence of protein by dip Stick.\r\nResults: As compared with the healthy controls the study reveals a significant reduction in Quicki test (increased IR) and low serum Mg2+ in all diabetic patients, with the presence of a significant positive correlation between the two parameters. Serum Mg2+ was significantly lower in the normal weight non proteinuric diabetics than the normal weight controls. In diabetic patients the presence of proteinuria caused a further reduction in serum Mg2+. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) negatively correlated with total serum Mg2+ in all diabetics and their controls. \r\nConclusions: Insulin resistance and poor glycemic control are important events associating hypomagnesaemia in type 2 DM.

It is generally accepted that pain after laparoscopy is multifactorial, and the surgeon is in a unique position to influence many of the putative causes by relatively minor changes in technique.\r\nObjective: To determine whether a drain placed in the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopy is both clinical and cost-effective method of reducing postoperative shoulder pain.\r\nMethods: One hundred female patients were having laparoscopic cholecystectomy were divided into two groups, a control group (50 patients) where no intra-peritoneal drain was inserted and second group (50 patients) in which the patients had intra-peritoneal gas drain sited in the subhepatic area. Patients\' age, weight, height, operative time, total amount of CO2 and amount of analgesia used were recorded for each patient in both groups. Shoulder pain was assessed using visual analogue score (VAS) from 1-5 scale at 4, 8, 24 & 48 hours postoperatively, where as abdominal pain was assessed at 48 hour post-operatively. pH of the abdominal fluid was assessed in the second group of patients by using pH meter 48 hours postoperatively. \r\nResults:Shoulder pain may occur in many of patients of the control group more frequent than those of the second group, where as postoperative abdominal pain was found to be greater in patients with subhepatic drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\r\nConclusion: Low-cost drain decreased the frequency of shoulder pain and reduced the need for analgesia, but increases the abdominal pain; however it is less cost-effective than simple oral analgesia after laparoscopy.\r\nKeywords: laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intra-abdominal drain, shoulder pain\r\n', '', 'upload/pdf/iraqijms57172405d2fe8.pdf', '', 0, '', 1, 53, 0, '2016-04-20 06:39:01', 0, 0, 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Hassan A.

Thus; its measurement provides a simple screening test for active organic disease .Increased CRP production is a very early and sensitive response to most forms of bacterial infection..\r\nObjective: was to ascertain whether infective exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and their successful treatment correlate with corresponding changes in CRP level.\r\nMethods: Fifty Patients (age 65 ± 6 years) diagnosed as COPD on the basis of clinical history and pulmonary function test were enrolled into the study. All those were admitted to Al-Kadhimya Teaching Hospital because of clinical exacerbations of their condition. Serum samples were obtained on admission from the patient for measurement of CRP and full blood count together with sputum sample for microbiological diagnosis (especially culture). CRP measured by semi quantitative method, the cutoff point of this test is 0.6 mg/L .So all positive values were ≥ 1.2 mg/L. All these patients with exacerbations were treated by conventional treatments. Blood samples for CRP, full blood count and forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FGV1) were repeated 4-5 days thereafter.\r\nResults: The levels of CRP were elevated ≥ 1.2 mg/L in 27 patients who were positive for bacterial culture .The average CRP level after adequate treatment was highly decreased (p value < 0.001) .There was a significant improvement in their measured FEV1 (p value < 0.001 ) . The peak CRP level and fall in CRP were significantly correlated with both the corresponding peripheral blood smear white cell count (r=0.57, p value < 0.001) and the correlation Coefficient between CRP and FEV1 was (r= -0.45, p value < 0.001).\r\nConclusions: Since patients with acute exacerbations of COPD had their CRP levels elevated initially and had clinical improvement with lowering of the CRP levels after treatment, there is a strong possibility that CRP is a marker of exacerbation of COPD. We suggest that, in exacerbation of COPD, CRP estimation provides a useful and inexpensive early marker of the exacerbation and provides a useful guide to assess the efficacy of treatment.\r\nKey words: C reactive protein, CRP, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with exacerbation.\r\n', '', 'upload/pdf/iraqijms57172fd92a8fb.pdf', '', 0, '', 1, 53, 0, '2016-04-20 07:29:29', 0, 0, 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Methaq A.

Since the suprameatal triangle covers the lateral wall of the mastoid air system, it is of importance to otologic surgeons during mastoidectomy.\r\nObjectives: To examine the relationships of the surgical landmarks on the lateral surface of the mastoid bone with the landmarks in a deeper location. Morphometric measurements were performed between the surgical landmarks (Macewen\'s triangle) and the sigmoid sinus plate.\r\nMethods: 30 dry human adult skulls were investigated. Three marks were allocated on the left and right sides of the norma lateralis of these skulls namely the tip of the mastoid process, the asterion, and the region of the suprameatal triangle (posterior border).\r\nResults: The measurements of (D1+D2), (D1+D3) and (D2+D3) showed statistical significant differences. The correlations of D1, D2 and D3 on the right and left sides showed statistical significant differences\r\nConclusion: The assessment of the depth of sigmoid sinus plate may be used as a mark that possibly point toward avoidance of the bleeding possibility during mastoidectomy. The suprameatal approach eliminates the need for mastoidectomy and avoids the damage of sigmoid sinus plate. If the depth can be assessed by measuring D1 and D2 on lateral X-rays of the heads as this study prove that we can avoid the dangerous complications which occur in the normal mastoidectomy.  \r\nKeywords: Suprameatal triangle, mastoidectomy\r\n', '', 'upload/pdf/iraqijms57173084d8f82.pdf', '', 0, '', 1, 53, 0, '2016-04-20 07:32:20', 0, 0, 3, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Mohammad O.

The prognosis of RCC depends on the size, stage, and grade of the tumor. CT has proved to be the most important imaging technique for the evaluation of renal lesions and the preoperative staging of renal cell carcinomas.\r\nObjective:The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of spiral CT in the preoperative assessment of patients with renal cell carcinoma correlated with histopathological findings.\r\nPatients and methods: Between February 2008 and September 2009, a prospective study included 40 patients (age range, 36–66 years; 28 men, 12 women) with solid renal masses. All the patients were diagnosed by CT as having renal cell carcinoma, underwent total nephrectomy & proved to be renal cell carcinoma at histopathlogical examination. In all patients, initial CT images were obtained without administration of contrast material, 100ml of Intravenous contrast material was administered, a repeated scan was done 120 seconds after contrast injection, both scans should covered the entire volume of the abdomen. Percentage of the parameters used in the study was calculated. Diagnostic accuracy of CT in staging renal cell carcinoma was calculated.\r\nResults: The study included 40 patients (28 men, 12 women) with solid renal masses. Tumor size ranged from 1.7 to 6.5 cm (mean size, 3.1 cm). All the patients showed evidence of contrast enhancement by about 47HU.\r\nThirty seven patients (92.5%) show heterogeneous enhancement while only 3 patients (7.5%) show homogenous enhancement. Calcification was seen in 10 patients (25%). A pseudocapsule was present in 16 patients. Lymph node (LN) involvement with adenopathies larger than 1 cm in diameter was found in 7 patients (17.5%), only one patient (2.5%) show false negative diagnosis, the over all diagnostic accuracy of LN detection was 83%. Renal vein or inferior vena cava thrombosis was detected in 8 patients (20%), diagnostic accuracy was 87.5%. The overall diagnostic accuracy of CT in staging renal cell carcinoma was 90% (36 out of 40).\r\nConclusions: CT is an excellent imaging technique for the evaluation of solid renal masses and the preoperative staging of renal cell carcinomas. CT has some difficulty in differentiating T3a from T2.

It is generally regarded as a safe procedure with limited morbidity and extremely rare mortality. It provides high diagnostic accuracy and has a relatively low complications rate.\r\nObjectives: The aims of our study were to report our experience with regard to the accuracy & pneumothorax rate of percutaneous CT-guided biopsy of solitary pulmonary nodules using automatic biopsy gun.\r\nPatients and methods: Between January 2006 and August 2009, 54 patients (46 men and 8 women) with solitary pulmonary nodule underwent CT guided transthoracic biopsy at Al-Kadhimiya Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq. All the lesions could not be diagnosed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. CT-guided biopsy was performed with an 18-gauge automatic biopsy gun. Chest radiography was done 2-4hr later and 24hr after biopsy for observation of pneumothorax. The overall diagnostic accuracy, pneumothorax rate, and chest tube insertion rate were determined. Diagnostic accuracy and pneumothorax rate were statistically compared according to lesion size & lesion depth (p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant).\r\nResults: Forty one patients (76%) diagnosed as malignant (diagnostic accuracy of 87.8%). Thirteen patients (24%) were diagnosed as benign (diagnostic accuracy of 92.3%). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 89% (48 of 54). The diagnostic accuracy did not differ with respect to the lesions size and lesions depth from the chest wall. Accurate diagnosis was made in 25 of the 29 nodules <20 mm (86%) and in 23 of the 25 nodules  20 mm (92%). Similarly accurate diagnosis was made for 36 (90%) of the 40 nodules shallower than 60 mm and for 12 (85.7%) of the 14 nodules  60 mm. Pneumothorax occurred in 23 (42%) patients. Pneumothorax occurred more frequently in small sized lesions (16 out of 29 lesions measuring <20 mm) as compared to (7 out of 25 lesions  20 mm) (P <0.05). similarly pneumothorax occurred more frequently in deeper lesions (10 out of 14 lesions   60mm in depth) as compared to (13 out of 40 lesions <60 mm in depth) (P <0.05). Only 7 (13%) patients requiring thoracostomy tube placement. \r\nConclusions: CT- guided biopsy using automatic biopsy gun allowing a specific diagnosis for benign & probably malignant lesions.

Skin is a major target for androgen activity, several hyperandrogenemia-triggered dermatologic alterations can be seen in PCOS, most commonly hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, acne, seborrhea, onycholysis, and onychorrhexis. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements required as a catalytic, structural, and regulatory ion for the activities of more than 300 enzymes, proteins, and transcriptional factors. Zinc insufficiency in the female can lead to complications such as impaired synthesis/secretion of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), abnormal ovarian development.\r\nObjective: To assess serum zinc level in patients with PCOS.\r\nMethods:	A case-controlled study was conducted in Al-Imamein Al-Kadhemein Medical City from the period of March to June 2016. Eighty females were enrolled in this study; their age ranged from 20 to 32 years. They were divided into 4 groups: Group I: Twenty patients with PCOS with body mass index (BMI) ranged from 30.0-40.0. Group II: Twenty normal healthy control obese ladies with BMI ranged from 30.0-40.0. Group III: Twenty patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with BMI ranged from 18.5-29.9. Group IV: Twenty females as a healthy control non-obese ladies with BMI ranged from 18.5-29.9.\r\nResults: Serum zinc level was significantly decreased in obese PCO group than in non-obese PCO group. Serum prolactin (PRL) level and LH levels were elevated in PCO group which was highly significant. There was negative correlation between serum zinc level and BMI in PCO patients.

Aim The clinical outcome of the overall recurrence after SND and RND in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma; relate the recurrence rate of pathological staging and the significance of PORT in reducing recurrence. Patients and methods: Fifty-eight Neck Dissection (ND) was done in 57 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma in Ramadi Teaching Hospital, Iraq from 2008 to 2014. In the first group there were 33 SND which were done in the clinically negative neck (cN0) and in the second group there 25 RND which were done in the clinical positive neck (cN+). Postoperative radiotherapy was given to six patients with cN0 and to 19 patients with cN+. Results: There were four recurrences in the first group (3 cases, ND without PORT, 1 case ND with PORT) and 6 recurrences in the second group (4 cases ND without PORT, 2 cases ND with PORT). Conclusion: there is a significant difference in tumor recurrence in the pathological positive neck (pN+) than the pathological negative neck (pN0) (9.6 times more recurrences in pN+). Tumor recurrence was not influenced statistically with the use of postoperative radiotherapy PORT in the clinically negative neck. There was a significant difference in recurrence in the clinical positive neck (cN+) (p- value >0.05).

There are many techniques that have been described to perform it either by the free hand operative methods or with the use of special devices.\r\nObjective: To evaluate the results of using Gomco clamp for circumcision as a preliminary experience in Iraq.\r\nMethods:	A total of 120 babies were subjected to circumcision by this device during the period from April 2014 - November 2015; their age ranges from 7 days - 11 months and they were divided into 3 groups: neonates, infants 1-3 months, infants 4-11 month. By using three different sizes of the clamp, the procedure was performed under local anesthesia in the majority of cases in a form of subcutaneous ring block with aid of sedatives while general anesthesia was given to those cases of coincidental circumcision with other operations. The outcomes of the procedure were assessed after one-month period of follow up.\r\nResults: 12.5% of cases were neonates; the average duration of the procedure was 20 minutes. A total complication rate of 9.16% was recorded (11 cases out of 120. The lowest rate of complication (6.6%) was seen in neonates, while the group of infants older than 4 months had the highest complication rate (10%). The most frequent complication recorded was bleeding (36.3% of all complication rate) followed by excess skin, infection, meatitis, epidermal inclusion cyst, no other complications were recorded.\r\nConclusion: Circumcision by Gomco clamp is a safe and simple method with good functional and cosmetic results if performed during neonatal period and early infancy.

This syndrome is characterized by an increase in the number of small antral follicles that are between 5-8 mm in size. Antemüllerian hormone (AMH) is secreted mostly by this type of follicle and when it is much too high, the production of a healthy egg every cycle can be halted as it works by reducing the receptors of the ovary to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).\r\nObjective: To compare the AMH level between women presented with PCOS with its level in normal ovulatory infertile women and to determine its correlation with the clinical, hormonal and ultrasonographic parameters in both groups.\r\nMethods:	This is a prospective cross-sectional study done at Um-Albaneen Infertility Center in Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City from march 2015 to January 2016. One hundred infertile women were recruited in this study, 50 women with PCOS and 50 women have other factors of infertility apart from PCOS and ovulatory dysfunction. Sera were taken from all the participants at day (2-3) of menstrual cycle and were investigated for AMH, FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), androstenedione, testosterone and estradiol (E2) levels. The number of early antral follicles (2-9 mm in diameter) was estimated by transvaginal ultrasound scanning.\r\nResults:	Level was significantly higher in PCOS women (42.6±23.8) compared to the normal ovulatory infertile women (16±7.5), P-value <0.001. There was positive correlation between AMH and LH, testosterone, androstenedione, number of antral follicles (antral follicle count) and ovarian volume. However, the correlation was negative with age, body mass index, estradiol, and FSH.\r\nConclusion: AMH strongly correlated with testosterone level and the number of small antral follicles in PCOS women, so it can be considered as a good diagnostic marker for PCOS.\r\nKeywords: Antimullerian hormone, PCOS. \r\nCitation:	Almoayad HA, Abdulrasul EA.

In multicellular organisms, cell-cell adhesion is critical for development and morphogenesis.\r\nObjective: To investigate the spatiotemporal organization of the immunohistochemical markers anti ZO-1 and anti Pan-cadherin during the prenatal development of the mice liver and to correlate the expression of these markers with histogenesis during hepatocyte maturation and biliary network formation.\r\nMethods:	Forty eight (48) pregnant mice were scarified at subsequent gestational days from day 14 till the first day of postnatal life. Paraffin blocks and sections of the liver extracted from the embryos obtained from these pregnant mice and from neonates at the first postnatal day of life were prepared. The sections were stained using the anti ZO-1 and anti Pan-cadherin immunohistochemical markers.\r\nResults: The sequential steps of anti ZO-1 indirect immunofluorescence reactivity in the developing liver tissue showed chronological variability, during days 14, 15, and 16; positive cell surface labeling was weaker adjacent to the blood vessels. The next step includes anti ZO-1 reactivity in late prenatal and postnatal liver tissue showing marked uniform reactivity. The sequential steps were also demonstrated in the anti Pan-cadherin immunohistochemical reactivity. The reactivity of the liver tissue during days 14, 15, and 16 showed disregarded cell surface labeling that increased markedly in later prenatal and postnatal periods.\r\nConclusion: The initial stages in the development include the undifferentiated specification the hepatic lineage characterized by regional establishment of zonula occludens in the developing liver cells and paucity in the development of the zona adherens complexes.

Clinical assessment, laboratory tests and imaging studies were under taken for 85 patients with uncomplicated liver hydatid cysts. Endocystectomy and or partial pericystectomy were undertaken. Post-operative follow up and management of biliary leakage for those with cysto-biliary communication not detected intra operatively. Data were analyzed to predict risk factors for occult CBC.\r\nResults: Of the 85 patients, 64 patients had no evidence of CBC neither intra nor postoperative, while the remaining 24 patients had an occult CBC, that have been discovered during operation or evident in the following days. Significant clinical predictors of communication were cyst size ≥ 10 cm, elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (P < 0.001). Other findings were associated more with patients having CBC than those without, including high white blood cell count (WBC), alkaline phospatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. Nine of 13 patients who developed post-operative bile leak stopped spontaneously, the other 4 patients mandate endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatgraphy (ERCP) to close their fistulas.\r\nConclusion: Awareness about the risk factors for CBC can predict preoperative diagnosis of occult CBC.

It was thought that the mild inflammation associated with obesity, and particularly the production of inflammatory adipocytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), was important in the etiology of the diseases associated with obesity. In particular, insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\r\nObjective: To investigate whether IL-6 and TNF-α play an important role in the etiology of IR and T2DM.\r\nMethods:	This study enrolled 70 T2DM patients randomly assigned into two subgroups, 35 non-obese (body mass index (BMI) < 30) diabetic group 1 and 35 obese (BMI ≥ 30) diabetic group 2 with another 50 healthy control volunteers, divided into two subgroups, 25 non-obese (BMI < 30) control group 1 and 25 obese (BMI ≥ 30) control group 2. Levels of IL-6, TNF-α, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B%) were examined.\r\nResults: The serum concentration of IL-6 of obese and non-obese diabetic patients was significantly (p < 0.05) lower as compared with obese and non-obese controls in contrast to the serum concentration of TNF-α, which was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in non-obese diabetic patients in comparison to non-obese controls. No significant correlation was observed for the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α with BMI of study population\r\nConclusion: The proposed link between serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) and T2DM was more related to insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and/or glycemic control than to adiposity.

The aim of this study is to use Iraqi kaolin clay as a natural adsorbent for the removal of thallium (I), cadmium (II), and arsenic (III) from aqueous solutions and comparing the results with purchased activated charcoal. This study was conducted in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq from April 2014 to April 2016. Batch adsorption method was used to study the effects of pH, agitation time, initial concentration, temperature, adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics. The adsorption of thallium (I), arsenic (III), and cadmium (II) fit the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 833.3, 22.03, 156.2 µg/g, respectively on Iraqi kaolin. While on activated charcoal thallium (I) and arsenic (III) both fit the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms but cadmium (II) fit the Freudlich isotherm better, and their  maximum adsorption capacities were found to be 500, 243.9, and 285.7 µg/g for thallium (I), arsenic (III), and cadmium (II), respectively. The kinetic investigations obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model for both adsorbents and with low energies of activation giving an indication that the adsorption process is mainly physical in its nature. On both adsorbents thallium (I) showed a spontaneous, endothermic adsorption with a positive ∆S for the higher concentration, and exothermic with negative ∆S for lower concentration of the metal. While the adsorption of arsenic (III) and cadmium (II) on both adsorbents was non-spontaneous and endothermic with positive ∆S for higher concentration and exothermic with negative ∆S for lower concentration. This study showed that Iraqi kaolin clay has a high efficiency for the removal of these toxic ions. A better removal of thallium (I) ions on kaolin than activated charcoal has been noticed in which kaolin gave a higher maximum adsorption capacity of 833.3µg/g rather than 500µg/g for activated charcoal. Furthermore, the tendency for the removal of thallium (I) ions from aqueous solution on both kaolin and activated charcoal were found to be greater than that of arsenic (III) and cadmium (II) following the order Tl(I) > Cd(II) > As(III) . Therefore, Iraqi kaolin is a great candidate as a low cost and a largely available adsorbent for the removal of toxic metal ions from aqueous solutions.', '', '', '', 122, 'Arsenic, batch adsorption, cadmium, Iraqi kaolin, thallium', 0, 0, 0, '2017-12-25 21:28:40', 0, 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0),

Although the majority of cases are familial, genetic studies have failed so far to identify the specific genes involved. The presentations of PCOS are heterogeneous and may change throughout the lifespan, starting from adolescence to post-menopausal age, and may have health impaction later in life. Omentin-1 is a fat depot-specific secretory protein produced by visceral stromal vascular cells. Recent studies showed that omentin-1 is correlated inversely with obesity and insulin resistance.\r\nObjective: To assess the serum omentin-1 concentration in PCOS women and the effect of metformin on omentin-1 level, to evaluate the role of omentin-1 on insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia in PCOS women and to look for the correlation of omentin-1 with body mass index (BMI) in PCOS women.\r\nMethods: Eighty women involved in this study; 40 women with PCOS diagnosed according to Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRMS 2003 criteria and 40 apparently healthy women considered as the control group. The participants were allocated into six groups: “10 obese women with PCOS (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, without metformin treatment)”. “10 obese women with PCOS (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, taking metformin)”. “10 non-obese women with PCOS (BMI <30 kg/m2, without metformin treatment)”. “10 non-obese women with PCOS (BMI <30 kg/m2, taking metformin)”. “20 obese controls and 20 non-obese controls. Blood samples were taken from them for estimation of fasting blood glucose, insulin and omentin-1 levels. Hirsutism score was also evaluated according to Ferriman–Gallwey score. \r\nResults: There was a significant increase in omentin-1 in non-obese PCOS (taking metformin) (3.02±0.71) compared to obese PCOS (taking metformin) (1.59±1.48) (P value = 0.0132) and in PCO non-obese (taking metformin) (3.02±0.71) compared with control non-obese (1.96±1.65) (P value = 0.121).

Most STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include: vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain.\r\nObjective: To detect the two microorganisms (Gardnerella vaginitis (G. vaginalis) and Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis)) in the same sample taken from women with genital tract infection by microbiological and molecular methods and to investigate the contributions of some socioeconomic factors and clinical features.\r\nMethods: Two hundred samples were collected from females attending the Gynecology out-patient department in the Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City and Baghdad Teaching Hospital during the period from May 2014 to April 2015. Based on availability of full clinical information about each patient, high vaginal swabs were taken from females at different ages (15-54 years) representing patients group complaining of abnormal vaginal discharge with or without other symptoms, questionnaire was applied. The two diseases associated with vaginal infection include G. vaginalis and T. vaginalis. Each of the vaginal swabs collected was examined microscopically, whilst the remaining was preserved at -20 °C for DNA extracts were analyzed with the real-time poly meres chain reaction (RT-PCR).   \r\nResults: In RT-PCR, the rate of infection was 120 (60%) G. vaginalis, and 34 (17%) T. vaginalis. Highest rate of infection in women with G. vaginalis was among age group (15-24) years and (25-34) years 38.3%, 35.0% respectively, the lowest rate was among age group (45-54) years 8.3 %. In T. vaginalis, the highest rate of infection was among age group (15-24) years 61.7 %, the lowest was among age group (35-44) years 8.8 % and on infection in age 45-54years.\r\nConclusion: The commonest genital tract infections among women were G. vaginalis and T. vaginalis. Molecular methods are considered the gold standard for diagnosis, given the excellent sensitivities and specificities in diagnosis. Presence of clinical symptoms helps and lab diagnosis of infection.

The age range exactly with mean ± SD or SE. E. coli were isolated by ordinary methods and the identification of non entero-pathogenic E. coli was performed at a group level by slide agglutination test with specific antisera. UPEC isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents by disc-diffusion method. ATG16L1 T300A genotyping was done by Species Specific Primer – Polymerase Chain Reaction (SSP-PCR), after genomic DNA extraction from each blood sample. \r\nResults: A total of sixty E. coli were isolated from 20 acute UTI (16 females and 4 males) and 40 chronic UTI (32 females and 8 males). There is a high rate of acute UTI among the age range exactly groups (≤10-20 years) and chronic UTI among age groups (21-40 years). Overall isolates had a complete resistance to Ampicillin and Gentamycin (100%), high resistance to Nalidixic acid (88%), Piperacillin (86%), Trimethoprime+Sulfa (84%), Cefotriaxon (80%), Ciprofloxacin (78%) and Cephalosporin (66%).

About half of population are affected by hemorrhoids during their life time. Conventional surgical hemorrhoidectomy, which was the standard treatment for many decades are associated with remarkable and intolerable pain that may last up to 3 to 6 weeks, which makes more patients reluctant to surgery. Laser hemorrhoidectomy is relatively new promising modality with less postoperative pain and less complications with fast wound healing and early return to work.\r\nObjective: To assess the validity, feasibility and the outcomes of using the CO2 diode laser for treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids.\r\nMethods:	A prospective study conducted for the period from September 2013 to April 2015, included 150 patients (135 male and 15 female), with symptomatic first, second and third degree piles with age ranged from 24 to 83 years (mean 48.7 year) submitted to CO2 diode laser hemorrhoidectomy with either the coagulation mode or cutting mode of 30 Watt diode laser surgical machine. The procedures were done under local anesthesia as a day case surgery by single surgeon. \r\nResults: The results showed that the operative time ranges from 15 to 30 minutes (mean 23.5 minutes). Postoperative pain scores by visual analog scale (VAS) in the first, second and third postoperative days were 2.9, 2.1, 1.8 respectively. The pain decreased rapidly after the first week and reached to zero after 14 days postoperatively. The complications rate recorded in this work was 7.3%. All these complications were mild and can be dealt with conservatively; redo surgery was not required in any case. All patients were discharged 2 to 4 hours postoperatively and were followed for 3 to 6 months.\r\nConclusion: Hemorrhoidectomy by CO2 diode laser is effective, and very quick outpatient procedure with very mild postoperative pain and low or negligible rate of complications. It associated with rapid healing and fast recovery that most patient can return to normal daily activity within 2 to 5 days.

Based on genetic content, L. monocytogenes can be divided into 3 lineages I, II and III. Several molecular methods have been developed to assist in the characterization of L. monocytogenes, macrorestriction analysis by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is one of the most used methods for the genotyping of L. monocytogenes.\r\nObjective: To determine the predominant genotype of L. monocytogenes isolated from clinical cases in a group of aborted Iraqi women.\r\nMethods:	A study was designed and included 15 clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes and one isolate from locally made cheese. The PFGE protocol was performed as described by Graves and Swaminathan. Briefly, bacterial suspensions adjusted to optical density of 1.3 at 610 nm were embedded in 1.2% Sea Kem Gold agarose plugs. The lysed, washed five times and a 2 mm thick piece was cut, equilibrated and digested with 200 μl of AscI enzyme master mix at 37 °C for 2 h. The macrorestriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a CHEF-DRIIBIO-RAD. Images were analyzed with the software Bio Numerics Gel Compar II version 6.6.11 (Applied Maths). \r\nResults: All L. monocytogenes isolates displayed AscI digestion profiles after incubation with the enzyme, about 6-12 majorfragments of 30 to 675 kb were obtained, sixteen isolates have been used in this study, however, 11 different AscI profiles were encountered, the distribution of the isolates according to the restriction profiles showed that two profiles were the most predominant A, A2 with a percentage of similarity of 100%.\r\n\r\nConclusion: L. monocytogenes genotyping showed profiles that can be well used in tracing down infection source and outbreak of this bacterium. PFGE represents a great discrimination and reproducibility method for molecular sub-typing of L. monocytogenes and it is considered the gold standard.\r\nKeywords: Listeria monocytogenes, genotyping, placenta, aborted women, pulse field gel electrophoresis\r\nCitation: Qassim KW, AL Attraqchi AAF, Khatab YI.

It is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, having both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic features.\r\nObjective: To investigate the integrity of the central motor pathways by studying the motor evoked potential (MEP) latencies, amplitudes and central conduction time (CMCT) of the median nerve in patients with PD as compared to healthy controls.\r\nMethods: Twenty-five patients with documented PD were studied; with a mean age of (63.16±5.49 years) as compared to 25 age and sex matched apparently healthy controls. All subjects were instructed about the examination and informed consent was provided. Transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-MEP study of the right median nerve was done. Cortical and cervical latencies and amplitudes of the MEP study were determined. The responses were recorded with both relaxed and slightly contracted target muscle. CMCT calculation was done by subtraction of the latency of peripheral segment of the motor pathway (spinal motor root to muscle) from that of the entire motor pathway (motor cortex to muscle) or by calculation of the CMCT with the F-wave method. \r\nResults: The means of the cortical latencies of PD patients during relaxation and facilitation states were lower than controls; and the differences were significant for both (P=0.03 and 0.02; respectively). In both relaxed and facilitation states, the means of CMCT in PD patients were lower than in control and the difference was significant during contraction (P=0.02), and near statistical significance during relaxation (P=0.08). CMCT calculations by the estimation of F wave and distal motor latency (DML) were equivocal between relaxation and facilitation states. Nevertheless, the differences were not statistically significant (P=0.45; P=0.62; respectively). The means of the MEP amplitude of PD patients were lower than controls (4.21±1.94 versus 4.28± 1.84 mV; respectively). Nevertheless, the differences were not significant (P=0.89).\r\nConclusion: Single-pulse TMS is a valuable study to investigate central motor dysfunction in PD.

Identification of the causative virus genotype is of a significance to both clinical practices and predict the likelihood to therapy response.\r\nObjective: To determine the distribution of HCV genotypes/subtypes and its association with response to therapy among newly diagnosed HCV patients.\r\nMethods:	Fifty patients with confirmed anti-HCV antibodies were included in this study for HCV genotyping in association with response to therapy. Blood samples from patients were subjected to RNA extraction and reverse transcription step; viral load of HCV was measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at time zero, 3 months and 6 months of dual therapy. Response to therapy was measured as a decrease in viral load (2 log or more) and was described as: good (median log is zero after 6 months of therapy), moderate (median log declines more than 2 log but not zero after 6 months of therapy), poor (median log does not decline or decline less than 2 log after 6 months of therapy).\r\nResults: Two genotypes of HCV were detected, genotype 4 was the predominant (27/50, 54%) followed by genotype 1 (23/50, 46%). For HCV subtypes, subtype 1a was of highest percentage (28%) followed by 4e (24%), 1b (18%), 4a (14%), 4b (12%), and 4e (4%).The results revealed a significant association between HCV subtypes, but not genotypes, with response to therapy. HCV subtype 1a followed by 4a showed the highest rate of response 85.7% and 71.4%, respectively, while interestingly HCV subtype 4d showed no response and 1b showed poor response 11.11%.\r\nConclusion: HCV subtypes of great importance in predicting success to HCV therapy and it is believed this would affect the newly emerging directly acting drugs as well.\r\nKeywords: HCV, genotypes, response to therapy\r\nCitation: Abdulhassan LJ, Abdulamir AS, Alkhalidi NM, Alwaysi SA.

Myogenic precursor cells are seen at E11.5 mouse embryo, when the 	first nerve fascicles begin to enter the limb. The first signs of musculature masses are seen at E12.5 in both fore and hind limb buds. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is essential in the development of the limbs. In vertebrate, the developing limb morphogenesis depends on the appropriate spatial and temporal balance between cell death and cell proliferation.\r\nObjective: To perform comprehensive analysis of the proximo-distal pattern of cell death, evaluated by (TUNEL test) in cross sections of mouse limbs during prenatal development after onset of primary myogenesis.\r\nMethods:	Fifteen pregnant female mice (Musmusculus) were divided into three groups according to the days of pregnancy into day (14, 16 and 19), only two embryos were taken from each mouse. All the limb buds were involved in this study. Paraffin embedded histological cross-sections of the limb buds were prepared, histological staining (using H&E stain) and TUNEL test labeling were done. Assessment of the number of apoptotic cells in the limb bud mesenchyme was done by counting these cells. \r\nResults: The H&E stained sections of the limb buds showed less amounts of mesenchymal tissues in older embryos (day 19). The TUNEL stain 	 showed active apoptotic changes at proximal parts of the limb buds at gestational day 19, while the distal parts of the limbs buds showed active apoptotic changes at the early days (day 14). The evaluation of TUNEL test reaction in the proximal regions showed statistical significant increase of apoptotic cells in day 19 compared to day 14 (p = 0.001 for both). The mean number of apoptotic cells in the proximal regions were statistically significant (p = 0.001) between day 16 and day 19. While the mean number of apoptotic cells of distal regions of the limb buds was higher at day 14 compared to that of day 16 and day 19. These differences between day 14 and day 16 were statistically significant and between day 16 and day 19 while statistically non-significant between day 14 and day 19. Comparison of mean number of apoptotic cells between proximal and distal regions in all the three groups showed a statistically significant higher mean number of apoptotic cells in the distal regions compared to proximal region (p = 0.001). The mean number of the apoptotic cells in both regions (proximal and distal) of the limb buds revealed statistically significant differences between day 16 and day 19 (p = 0.001). \r\nConclusion: Apoptosis was higher in all parts of the developing limbs during day 19, and that could be associated with degenerative changes occurring at the apical ectodermal ridge. Moreover, apoptosis was higher in the distal part of the limb bud and this may be due to more differentiation of the distal parts than in the proximal part of the limb bud.\r\nKeywords: Development, limb bud, mouse, embryo, TUNEL, apoptosis, mesenchyme\r\nCitation: Al-Musawi DML, Mubarak HJ.

Corneal endotheliopathy is one of these presentations.\r\nObjective: To evaluate corneal endothelial cell morphology, density and function in eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome.\r\nMethods:	120 eyes of sixty patients with clinically evident unilateral pseudoexfoliation were examined with non-contact specular microscopy (SP-3000P) Topcon Corporation. Central corneal thickness (T), cell density (CD), and percentage of cell hexagonality (HEX%) were measured and the values of the affected eyes were compared to those of the fellow normal eyes. Corneas with CD less than 2000/mm2 or HEX% <50% were considered as at-risk corneas for decompensation. The pseudoexfoliated eyes were subdivided into three groups according to the density of the pseudoexfoliated material (those with deposits on the lens capsule alone, on the pupil margin alone or on both) and the morphometric values of endothelial cells in each group were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using a 2-tailed Student t-test and the Chi square test, P value <0.05 was considered significant. \r\nResults: Significant increase in central corneal thickness (500.25±28.95 micron vs 493.18±28.59 micron) and reduction in endothelial cell density (2307.5±272.3 vs 2480.2±289.9 cell/mm2) with a non- significant decrease in cell hexagonality (51.78±8.9 vs 53.48±6.2 %) was noticed in eyes affected by pseudoexfoliation syndrome as compared to the contralateral normal eyes. The changes were noticed more when the severity of the condition increases as reflected by the density of the pseudoexfoliated material. At risk corneas were found more frequently in eyes with pseudoexfoliation based on both endothelial cell density and cell hexagonality. \r\nConclusion: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a cause of corneal endotheliopathy and a risk for corneal decompensation. More endothelial cell changes are found in eyes with advanced pseudoexfoliation.

The primary cause is secondary hypoparathyroidism following damage to or devascularization of one or more parathyroid gland during surgery.\r\nObjective: To identify the occurrence rate of post-operative hypocalcemia as an indicator of parathyroid gland function and its relation to the type of the surgical procedure of thyroidectomy whether it’s a subtotal or total thyroidectomy.\r\nMethods:	One hundred and ninety patients with total and subtotal thyroidectomy were selected in this study (144 females and 46 males). The patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (95 patients) represent the patients with total thyroidectomy, and group 2 (95 patients) represent the patients with subtotal thyroidectomy. Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone were done pre-operatively and post-operatively for all patients with a follow-up for serum calcium for 6 months. \r\nResults: Of the total number serum calcium levels decreased from pre-operative levels in 156 patients (82%), but still within normal range (2.1-2.6 mmol/L). The overall incidence of transient hypocalcemia was 22 % (42 patients), 35 patients belong to group 1 and 7 patients to group 2, and that of permanent hypocalcemia (hypocalcemia persisted   at the 6 months assessment) was 2.6 % (5 patients), 4 patients belong to group 1 and one patient to group 2. Most of the patients with hypocalcemia were asymptomatic 19.4% (n=37) and did not require calcium supplementation. Symptomatic hypocalcemia occurred in 5.2 % (n =10) patients. It was found that the overall incidence of hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy was 24.7 % (22% transient and 2.6% permanent). \r\nConclusion: It could be concluded that, insuring the integrity of parathyroid glands is important to avoid post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. If incidental removal or devascularization of the parathyroid glands is noted, parathyroid auto-transplantation should be done.\r\nKeywords: Post-operative hypocalcemia, total thyroidectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy.\r\nCitation: Naji RE.

Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and act as a partial agonist on the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), that has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects.\r\nObjective: To evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of telmisartan in patients with knee OA.\r\nMethods:	Forty-two patients with painful knee OA were allocated into 2 groups, group (1): patients treated with naproxen tablets (500 mg/12 hr), telmisartan tablets (40 mg/day) and omeprazole (20 mg/day) for 3 months, while group (2): patients treated with naproxen tablets (500 mg/12 hr) and omeprazole (20 mg/day) for 3 months. The serum levels of IL-1β, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), TNF-α and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured before and after 3 months of treatment.\r\nResults: Telmisartan when used in combination with naproxen resulted in significant decrease in serum levels of IL-1β and hs-CRP, higher than that produced by naproxen when used alone. The mean TNF-α level and ESR was decreased non-significantly in both study groups.\r\nConclusion: Administration of telmisartan as an adjuvant therapy to naproxen in knee OA patients produced a significant decrease in the serum levels of IL-1β and hs-CRP, though no clear effect on TNF-α and ESR was noticed after 3 months treatment. Accordingly, many promising preventive strategies emerged from the available results since telmisartan relatively reduce the inflammatory burden in OA patients.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an essential role in the preoperative assessment of the disease, therefore improving post-operative surgical outcome.\r\nObjective: To study the role of MRI in the evaluation of perianal fistula and to show the value of using contrast enhanced MR study in the determination of the precise tract pathway, extensions and other associated pathologies.\r\nMethods:	A cross sectional analytic study was conducted on a total of 32 patients with perianal fistulas in the MRI Department of Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq during the period from November 2015 to December 2016. Patients underwent MRI examination using axial and coronal T2 weighted images with and without fat suppression and T1 fat suppressed sequences before and after contrast administration. The type of fistula, location of the internal opening, associated abscesses and/or sinus tracts and horseshoe extension were evaluated using different MR sequences. \r\nResults: The most common type of fistula encountered was the inter-sphincteric type, which was seen in 21 patients (66%), of those patients 16 fistulas (50%) were grade I and 5 fistulas (16%) were grade II. Trans-sphincteric fistulas were seen in 9 patients (28%), 2 of them (6%) were grade III and 7 fistulas (22%) were grade IV. Two patients (6%) had extra-sphincteric type. T2 weighted TSE, T2 TSE with fat suppression and T1 weighted fat suppressed post contrast sequences all show significant correlation with surgical results (with p-value less than 0.05) and the highest significance was obtained by the post contrast sequence (p-value of 0.00001). The highest accuracy in the diagnosis of fistula in ano was with the use of T1 enhanced fat suppressed sequence (98.8%) followed by 87% for the T2 fat suppression sequence and only 57% for the T2 weighted TSE sequence.\r\nConclusion: MRI is an essential, noninvasive tool in the preoperative assessment of perianal fistulous tracks, with the axial and coronal post contrast fat suppression T1 providing the highest accuracy and clinical significance with surgical data and therefore giving a highly promising decrement in the incidence of post-operative complications.\r\nKeywords: MRI, perianal fistula\r\nCitation: Jawad AM, kadhim MA, Al-Jobouri ZK, Hussain MAA.

It is also prescribed to diabetic mellitus (DM) patient for treatment of neuropathic pain. Changes in lipid levels and lipid metabolism usually accompanied with diabetic disease leading to increases in circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides and dense low-density lipoprotein together with reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\r\nObjective: To investigate the effect of sodium valproate on lipid profile and glucose level and highlight these effects with and without diabetic disease.\r\nMethods: Thirty-two healthy, local domestic rabbits of both sexes were used in the present study. Animals were allocated into two main groups, group A and B. According to induction of diabetes both groups received the same food and put in the same environmental condition. blood glucose level and lipid profile has been done for all groups.\r\nResults: There was significant difference in the blood glucose level in the normoglycemic rabbits treated with sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) compared to the untreated (negative control group). The effect of valproate was also observed by the significant difference of blood glucose level in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits treated with sodium valproate (200 mg) compared with the positive control group. Also, we have statistically observed the significant increase in total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein – cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels in normoglycemic rabbits treated with sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) compare to the negative control group, however, there is no significant difference regarding the high-density lipoprotein – cholesterol (HDL-C) level. As for the alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits, there was a statistically significant difference observed indicated an increase in level of TC, LDL-C, and TG and a decrease in HDL-C.\r\nConclusion: The effect of sodium valproate on glucose level and lipid profile in diabetic rabbits could reflect a possible hypoglycemic and dyslipidemic effects which could be dangerous if the patient is on anti- diabetic drugs with or without cardiovascular accident, although it may be dose-dependent and still falls in the hypothesis field but further experimental studies on human are needed to explore this theory.\r\nKeywords: Sodium valproate, anticonvulsants, glucose, lipid\r\nCitation: Abdul Bari MA.

The positive urine cultures can be obtained not only from Struvite stones, but also from calcium oxalate stones and also high levels of endotoxins are found both in infection stones (Struvite and carbonate apatite stones), and in non-infection stones. High concentrations of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) are thought to be released in the systemic circulation during stone treatment, inducing a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) and this leads to urosepsis. Pre-Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) prophylactic antibiotics have an important role in reducing post-SWL infections, however, previous studies reported conflicting results. The issue of administering prophylactic antibiotics remains controversial in patients with sterile urine undergoing ESWL.\r\nObjective: To evaluate possible risk factors for post ESWL bacteriuria and consequently to identify patients with higher danger for urinary tract infection (UTI) or sepsis.\r\nMethods:	Urine samples from 50 patients underwent ESWL, were collected by clean catch mid-stream urine collection method in sterile containers. Those patients were attending and admitting to Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City during the period from October 2016 to January 2017. All patients had a urine culture performed before and after shock wave lithotripsy. Statistical analysis was performed with Epi-Info 7 and Excel programs.

However, there is little information about its frequency and importance as a cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in Iraq.\r\nObjective:To assess the frequency of hBoV and co-infection rate in infants and young children with LRTI.\r\nMethods:	Nasopharyngeal/throat swabs were collected during the peak winter months from 100 hospitalized infants and young children less than 5 years of age with LRTI in Baghdad, Iraq. Five viruses were investigated by Multiplex Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).\r\nResults: It was found that 71 (71%) had a viral infection either single or mixed. Six out of 100 samples (6%) were hBoV positive, 10 (10%) were parainfluenza virus positive, 12 (12%) tested positive for adenovirus, 58 (58%) were rhinovirus positive and none of the samples gave positive results for coronavirus. Sixteen samples showed mixed infection with rhinovirus, eight of these (8%) with parainfluenza virus, 6 (6%) with adenovirus, and 2 (2%) with hBoV. There were no significant differences between the viral infected and non-infected patients with respect to age, gender, crowding status, gestational age, diagnosis at presenting and hospital stay (the average stay of viral-infected patients in the hospital was three days). In contrast, exposure to smoking was significantly more associated with viral-infected children than virus-free children (80% vs. 44.83%, P<0.001). In addition, viral-infected children showed significantly less proportion for need for intensive care unit than virus-free children (15.5% vs. 79.31%, P<0.001). Breastfeeding was found to have significant adverse association with viral infection (P<0.001). About one-third of viral-infected children had a medical history involving a disease other than respiratory infection (P<0.001). Finally, viral-infected children were reported to have longer period of illness before hospital admission (6.32±5.49 days) than virus-free children (6.32±5.49 days vs. 3.38±2.37 days, P<0.01).  \r\nConclusion: More than two third of children with respiratory tract infection have been viral infection either single or mixed.

The relationship between clinical features of the patients and the degree of stenosis is not clear and there is no accepted “gold standard” for the diagnosis of lumbar stenosis.\r\nObjective:To evaluate the relationship between the degree of radiologically confirmed stenosis and the severity of Oswestry disability Index and to assess the most valid parameter for the diagnosis of the lumbar stenosis.\r\nMethods;A cross-sectional study conducted on randomly selected patients with lumbar stenosis at Magnetic Resonance Image Unit of Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City in Baghdad from May to September 2018. All patients filled Oswestry disability Index questionnaire and underwent examination using 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance unit (Avanto, SIEMENS).\r\nResults:A total of 41 patients were included (51.46±12.62) years of age. The measurements of spinal canal including the cross-sectional area of dural sac at intervertebral levels, stenosis ratio, and depth of lateral recesses are found to be correlated significantly with the level of disability assessed by Oswestry disability Index. At all levels, neither the cross-sectional area of the lateral recesses nor Ligamentous interfacet distance correlated significantly to the level of disability.\r\nConclusion:Magnetic resonance image measurements of spinal canal correlated to the level of disability.

They were presented to the Coronary Care Unit of Basrah General Hospital with acute inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The 12 leads plus right-sided precordial electrocardiograms were done to all patients within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, and ST-segment elevation was measured. ST-segment elevation in lead III exceeding lead II was defined as a ratio of elevation in lead III: II>1. Patients grouped according to ST-segment elevation III:II ratio into either >1 or ≤1. In-hospital morbidity and mortality were studied in both groups.\r\nResults:ST-segment elevation ratio > 1was detected in 68 patients (68.7%) with acute inferior myocardial infarction at time of admission. Right ventricular infarction was diagnosed in 33 (33.3%) patients, with the majority (32 patients) have ST-elevation ratio > 1. Thirty-Six patients had at least one of the in-hospital complications with significantly higher incidence (51.4%) in patients with higher ST elevation ratio. The mortality was statistically higher when ST segment elevation level in the lead III > than that in the lead II.\r\nConclusion:In patients with inferior STEMI, ST-segment elevation in the lead III more than lead II can be a potential marker of the presence of right ventricular infarction in association with inferior myocardial infarction.

We used laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of 40 patients aged between one and 12 years (median age 4.9 years) with unilateral nonpalpable undescended testis. Boys with a palpable testis at any point were excluded from the study. Surgical procedure was individualized according to the laparoscopic findings either by one stage laparoscopic orchiopexy, two stage Fowler-Stephens procedure or laparoscopic orchiectomy.\r\nResults:Laparoscopy was able to diagnose the site of the nonpalpable testes in all the patients. Out of 40 nonpalpable undescended testes, 26 testes (65%) were intra-abdominal (12 testes were low intra-abdominal, 14 testes were high intra-abdominal). In 9 patients, (22.5 %), the vas deferens and spermatic vessels were found entering the internal inguinal ring. In 3 patients, (7.5 %), the testes were vanishing, and the testes were absent in 2 patients (5%). All patients with low intra-abdominal testes (n=12) were subjected to one stage laparoscopic orchiopexy through the normal inguinal ring. Out of 14 patients with high intra-abdominal testes, 7 patients underwent two staged Fowler-Stephens laparoscopic procedures, while three patients were treated by laparoscopic Prentiss maneuver and the remaining 4 patients underwent immediate laparoscopic orchiectomy due to presence of an atrophied testis. Patients with the vas deferens and spermatic vessels entering the internal inguinal ring (n=9) were treated by orchiopexy via conventional inguinal approach.\r\nConclusion:Laparoscopy for unilateral nonpalpable testis has an excellent diagnostic yield combined with high success rate following repair.\r\nKeywords:Laparoscopy, nonpalpable undescended testis, Fowler-Stephens procedure\r\nCitation:Zain AZ, Mohammed NH, Fadil SZ, Abdul-Hassan BA.

One of the suggested environmental factors that lead to development of systemic lupus erythematosus is infection with Epstein-Barr virus.\r\nObjective: First, detection and quantification of Epstein-Barr virus in peripheral blood of systemic lupus erythematosus patients compared to control. Second, estimation of mRNA level of latent and lytic genes and compare them with control groups.\r\nMethods:	This a case-control study conducted on systemic lupus erythematosus patients during the period from (December 2018 to March 2019). A total of 40 patients were involved in this study. Blood samples were taken from Baghdad Teaching Hospital of Medical City. On the other hand, 40 blood samples were collected from apparently healthy subjects, as control samples from blood donor center in Al-Imamein Al-kadhimein Medical City.\r\nResults: Eleven of forty (27.5%) of systemic lupus erythematosus patients were positive with Epstein-Barr virus at mean viral load 815.72 copy/ml with (P value 0.59). And the rate of Epstein-Barr virus detection in blood of patients group was highest in severe cases rather than in less severe ones. Only 2/40 (5%) of control subjects were positive with Epstein-Barr virus at much lower mean viral load, 64.75 copy/ml (P Value 0.34).

Those patients divided into two groups: VDD group and DDD group; each consisted of 24 patients. The VDD and DDD pacemakers were implanted in the patients and the tests of efficacy and sensitivity were done at implantation and in the follow up periods (2nd day of implantation, 10 days, 1 month, and 3 months after implantation) for both groups. These tests were: Atrial sensitivity, atrial lead impedance, P-wave amplitude, event histogram (% of atrio-ventricular synchronous pacing), duration of implantation, and duration of fluoroscopy. The outcomes of these tests were compared in both groups. \r\nResults: Forty eight patients were implanted; half of them received DDD pacemakers, and the other 24 received VDD pacemakers. At the time of implantation and during the 3 moths of follow up, the DDD group showed significant higher efficacy and sensitivity than the VDD group. After implantation; the mean P-wave amplitude, atrial sensing threshold, atrial lead impedance, and % of AV synchrony were 3.42±1.1 mV; 3.46±1.3mV; 568±103.42Ω; 95%±7% respectively in DDD group, while they were 2.91±1.3 mV; 2.46±1.18mV; 624.2±136.26Ω; 90%±8% respectively in VDD group. Implant time was significantly reduced in VDD patients (61.82±14.6 min.) compared with DDD group (72.62±10.4 min.) (p<0.05).\r\nConclusion: the dual lead DDD pacing is superior to single lead VDD pacing for long term maintenance of AV synchronous pacing in symptomatic 2nd degree and complete heart block with preserved SA node function.

Tail blood sample were obtained twice from all animals; at zero day and after 8 weeks, for measurement of osteocalcin. Then after 8 weeks all animals were sacrificed and dissected for extraction of femoral bone for measuring bone length, weight, thickness and bone ultrastructure under light microscope by staining with hematoxylin and eosin.\r\nResults: The osteocalcin, femoral bone weight, length, thickness, haversian thickness and lamellar thickness showed significant increase in value of group A in comparison to group B and group C which show a significant decrease in femoral bone thickness, haversian thickness, lamellar thickness, and osteocalcin level.\r\nConclusion: Exercise training has an anabolic effect on bone, in contrast to restriction movement that cause catabolic effect on bone. Osteocalcin increases with exercise and could be used as a marker in monitoring the exercise program therapy.\r\nKeywords: Femoral bone weight, length, thickness, haversian thickness, lamellar thickness, osteocalcin\r\nCitation: Musleh AM, Hashim ZH, Jaafar HA.

Cervical disc herniation, accompanied by cervical spondylosis, is among the most common causes of radiculopathy. Clinical neurophysiology is a medical field focused mainly on assessing activity in the nervous system and muscles being an expansion of neurological assessment, using particular same anatomical localization criteria as clinical testing.\r\nObjective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of conduction time of the intraspinal segment of peripheral motor neurons in the diagnosis of CR using cervical root magnetic stimulation and conventional electromyography (EMG) study.\r\nMethods: Fifty patients (15 males and 35 females) aged 46.02±9.76 years with reported CR were subjected to an electrophysiological examination and control group consisted of 50 (36 females and 14 males) healthy volunteers aged 36.24±12.09 years. Analysis of sensory and motor nerve conduction, conventional needle EMG test, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for all (recording abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), biceps brachii (BB), deltoid muscles) was conducted to determine the peripheral nerves, muscles, sensory and motor pathways. The motor evoked potential (MEP) parameters studied for the median, ulnar musculocutaneous and axillary nerves include latency of the spinal root {peripheral motor conduction time} (PMCT).\r\nResults: During direct cervical root stimulation, the PMCT of the median nerve shows the highest specificity (59%) than that of the ulnar nerve (57%), while the intraspinal latency shows the same specificity for both nerves (57%). In comparison, PMCT by kimura formula recording ADM during direct stimulation of the cervical root have the highest sensitivity (56%) than that of PMCT by kimura formula recording APB. Additionally, the recording of direct cervical root stimulation amplitude after deltoid muscle showed the highest specificity and sensitivity (57.0%, 58.0% respectively). On the other hand, PMCT shows the highest specificity and sensitivity while the BB muscle is recoded (62.0%, 49.0%).\r\nConclusion: Overall, the current motor evoked potential study shows abnormalities in less than 60% of patients with cervical radiculopathy relative to conventional EMG needle study abnormalities that reached 90%.

Spread of infection outside the sinuses to the surrounding brain and orbit results in complicated sinusitis. Complications are more common in children than adults due to anatomical and immunological factors. \r\nObjective: To identify the correlation of orbital manifestations with computed tomography (CT) scan findings in diagnosing and classifying the disease, the efficacy of various treatment modalities and the outcome of these complications in children.\r\nMethods:	A prospective study of 16 patients who presented with orbital swelling and features of acute rhinosinusitis was conducted in the Otorhinolaryngology Department at Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City from April 2014 to October 2015. A full history, ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination including naso-endoscopic examination (if possible), ophthalmological assessment and CT scan of nose and paranasal sinuses were done. Patients were classified to have either pre-or postseptal infection depending on CT findings. All patients were admitted to the ENT ward, received intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive measures and kept under close observation with monitoring of ophthalmological manifestations and vital signs. Some patients responded to medical treatment and others required surgical intervention. All patients after recovery were discharged home on oral antibiotics for 2 weeks and followed up monthly for a total duration of 3 months.\r\nResults: The majority of patients were males (62.5%). Mean ages of patients was 8.9±2.9 years with a range (4 to 15) year. Preseptal cellulitis was more common (62.5% vs. 37.5%). Impaired visual acuity, impaired extraocular movement and proptosis were significantly associated with postseptal infections as the P values were 0.01, 0.003 and 0.003 respectively. Preseptal cellulitis responded well to medical treatment. Postseptal abscesses required surgical drainage using an external, endoscopic or combined approach. 94% of patients had complete recovery without any sequel.\r\nConclusion: Orbital manifestations are strongly correlated with CT findings. Medical treatment is very effective for preseptal infection. The choice of surgical approach for managing postseptal infection will depend upon, the site and extension of the abscess and the state of the nasal cavity.

It is also responsible for stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart and kidney failure in addition to its huge effect on the economy. Iraq, like many developing countries is undergoing a transitional epidemiological period with increasing burden of hypertension and its contributory risk factors e.g. unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, hyperglycemias, hypercholesterolemia and smoking. In spite of the availability of a screening program for early detection of hypertension in PHCCs little data on hypertension control is available. Aim: assess blood pressure control rate among Iraqi adults 18 years and older, and identify the related determinants. Method: The study is derived from the Non-Communicable Diseases Risk Factors STEPS survey Iraq 2016. A cross‐sectional survey was conducted on households from Iraqi governorates apart from three governorates for unstable situation. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used for a sample of 4120 Iraqi adults. Interviews started from the first week of November for 20 days using Arabic and Kurdish translated versions of STEPS questionnaire. A total of 4071 residents participated. Results: the prevalence of hypertension/ high blood pressure was 35.6%. Only 7.9% were under medication and controlled with an evident sex based difference in favour of women (9.3 vs. 6.6 respectively).

Postoperative pain should be assessed regularly and documented carefully as it is a significant part of postoperative care. Pain scales are useful for assessment and monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. The 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS) are the most commonly used one.\r\nObjective: To compare between VAS and NRS for assessing post-operative pain in patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy.\r\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was done in Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City from the period of 1st of October 2019 to the 1st of March 2020. Fifty patients were enrolled in this study. All underwent elective cholecystectomy. Patient consents were obtained. Pain assessment was done when patients fully recovered and asking for pain relief and then one hour after giving analgesia.\r\nResults: Of the 50 patients, females were 42 (84%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been done for 45 (90%); 33 (66%) patients received parenteral opioid and paracetamol, the remaining 17 (34%) received only paracetamol. There were no significant correlations between most of the suggested risk factors and pain perception apart from type of medications used for pain control. There is strong correlation between NRS and VAS before and after analgesia (P< 0.01), while no observed significant effect or relation between other demographic and surgical parameters on pain score rating.\r\nConclusion: This study validated that both the NRS and the VAS are two comparable acute pain scores mostly used in practice.

Tamoxifen as estrogen receptor blockers have been used as empiric treatments for male infertility, acting through blocking estrogen receptor at the hypothalamus and pituitary levels and so preventing the important negative feedback of estrogens to the pituitary and hypothalamus as a result that leading to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation and pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\r\nObjective: To assess tamoxifen role in the treatment of men with primary infertility who are   normogonadotropic.  as it is widely prescribed drug for that purpose as well as to evaluate possible patient’s criteria for a better response to tamoxifen.\r\nMethods: One hundred twenty-three patients with idiopathic primary infertility and normal FSH, LH, and testosterone serum levels were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients received 20 mg tamoxifen daily as a single dose for at least 3 months, and semen analysis (total sperm concentration, total number of progressive motile sperms and percentage of normal sperm morphology) as well hormones levels were evaluated, with the values being compared with those before treatment.\r\nResults: Overall, there was no statistically-significant improvement in semen parameters 3 months after treatment (P>0.05); however, patients with pretreatment lower normal FSH level of (1.7-6.85 mIU/ml) and those with pretreatment sperm concentration of (five to ten million per ml) showed statistically significant improvement in sperm concentration after tamoxifen therapy (p=0.044 and p=0.012 respectively). \r\nConclusion: Tamoxifen is an acceptable treatment for idiopathic male infertility. A better response can be expected in patients with pretreatment lower normal FSH level of (1.7-6.85 miu/ml) and sperm concentration of 5-10 million per ml.

The risk of developing MS enlarged by infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by delayed primary infection by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Early reports consistently demonstrated an increased antibody response in MS patients versus healthy subjects towards different EBV antigens, including the EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1). In Iraq, number of researchers found that the EBV have a possible role at some point in the course of the disease, others reported that the EBV pathogenesis have an important role in the triggering of MS disease.\r\nObjective: To compare the sero-prevalence of EBV nuclear antigen-1 antibody (EBNA-1 IgG) among the Iraqi MS patients and controls and find out whether there is a relation between disease severity and EBNA-1 IgG titer.\r\nMethods: This case-control study conducted on 120 MS patients aged between 13-42 years, and 120 apparently healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers as controls. Three ml of whole blood were collected from all MS patients and controls and put in gel tubes. The blood samples were centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 5 minutes to get serum from the gel tubes. Serum was preserved in (-20ºC), and then used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA study was performed using ELISAs kits (Abnova /Taiwan) for EBNA-1 IgG antibodies measurement.\r\nResults: EBNA-1 IgG was positive in 51.7% (62/120) of MS patients and 39.2% (47/120) of controls, (P=0.035). The median of EBNA-1 IgG level of MS patients and controls were 81.08 U/ml, and 67.73 U/ml, respectively (P=0.043). And EBNA-1IgG was significantly higher in younger age groups. Patients with the first-line and second-line treatment showed no significant differences in EBNA-1 IgG levels, while the median level in patients without treatment (newly diagnosed) and those who were at early years of the disease was higher.\r\nConclusion: EBNA-1 antibody could play a triggering role in MS because it is significantly higher in MS patients than in controls, especially at younger age groups, early stages of the disease and in female patients.\r\nKeywords: Multiple sclerosis, EBV, EBNA-1 IgG, ELISA\r\nCitation: Ali ZA, Al-Obaidi AB, Almashta SA.

One of the common features of β-thalassemia is ineffective erythropoiesis because of the imbalance of globin chain production, which result in increased apoptosis during erythroblast maturation.   \r\nObjective: To evaluate the ß/α globin mRNA ratio in patients with ß-thalassemia syndrome and   to correlate   the ß/α ratio with hematological and clinical condition of the patients.\r\nMethods: Thirty-five patient samples were collected from Thalassemia Centre of Ibn Al-Balady Hospital; 18 patients with β-thalassemia major and 17 patients with β-thalassemia intermedia. The patients were randomly selected regarding sex, whereas their age ranged from 3 to 17 years. Along with those samples, twenty control leftover samples that were the remaining of samples collected for laboratory investigation, were taken from Al-Kadhimiya Pediatric Hospital, and were age and sex matched with the patients group. The α and β globin chain ration were calculated by the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The β/α -globin mRNA ratio of the samples was measured by the 2−ΔΔCT method. \r\nResults: Analysis of the β-globin/α-globin mRNA ratio showed that disease severity increased with a reduction of the ratio. There was a highly significant difference in α level, ß level and ß/α   ratio among studied groups with a p value of (p < 0.001).  The highest level was in control group, followed by that in β-thalassemia intermedia and the lowest was in β-thalassemia major.\r\nConclusion: The severity of ß/α globin chain imbalance showed a significant and negative correlation with the     mean corpuscular volume and there was no significant correlation between the ß/α ratio and markers of erythropoiesis in ß-thalassemia major and ß-thalassemia intermedia patients. The ß/α ratio was a good tool for diagnosis in ß-thalassemia major and ß-thalassemia intermedia as compared to control group with high sensitivity and specificity.

Mortality and risk of recurrent stroke are high with the possibility of misdiagnosis. As a result, an effective mode of examination is required for early diagnosis.\r\nObjective: To investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in patients with posterior circulation ischemic stroke (PCIS).\r\nMethods: Twenty patients with PCIS aged 40 to 70 years were studied, along with 20 age-matched healthy controls. Medical history was taken, as well as a clinical neurological examination and BAEPs.\r\nResults: Waves IV and V latencies, and III-V inter-peak latencies were significantly prolonged and wave V amplitude was significantly reduced in patients with PCIS. Fifteen patients with PCIS show retrocochlear (central) dysfunction abnormality. Wave V latency and amplitude showed the highest estimated specificity and sensitivity with 80 % and 90%, respectively. Wave V latency negatively correlated with a duration from onset of stroke to neurophysiological examination.\r\nConclusion: BAEPs are a useful tool as a biomarker for the clinical evaluation of PCIS. Wave V latency and amplitude is the most specific and sensitive among BAEPs parameter in the diagnosis of PCIS. Topographic distribution of the lost BAEP waves (according to diffusion-weighted MRI findings) may be closely linked to lost generators of individual waves, which suggests regional diagnostic validity of BAEPs.

However, black tea accounts for 78% of global tea consumption, while green tea accounts for only 20%. Except for flavored tea, all types of tea are made from the dried leaves of the tea bush. The type of tea is determined by the degree of oxidation of the leaves. Unoxidized tea leaves are used to make tea leaf, which is one of the less processed varieties of tea. It therefore, contains the most powerful antioxidants and beneficial polyphenols. Green tea polyphenols include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins, and flavanols, all of which are being studied in the lab for their potential in vivo effects. Kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin are three types of flavonoids found in various parts.

Wine and cuisine are flavored with the blades, berries, and branches. Due to its high vitamin content, mature fruits were once utilized as a food integrator. It has been demonstrated in numerous studies that the myrtle plant\'s various parts contain a variety of bioactive substances. The plant\'s fruit and leaves both contain phenolic chemicals and anthocyanin, as well as quercetin, catechin, and myricetin. Numerous biologically active compounds are produced by the plant, including tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, strong oil, essential oils, fibers, carbohydrates, citric acid, malic acid, and antioxidants. The bioactive chemicals found in various myrtle plant sections are regarded to have beneficial benefits on health. According to earlier research, the plant has antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerative, anti-diarrheal, analgesic, and hair-growing properties. More human researches are required because it has been shown that the majority of these investigations are conducted on animals.\r\nKeywords:Myrtus communis Linn; antioxidant activity, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activity, antiulcerative and antidiarrheal activity; analgesic effect and effect on hair growth\r\nCitation:Abass HA, Mahmeed BA, Omran ZS.

Earlier infections are threatening in pregnant women. The activity of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in defense against T. gondii infections was observed such as TLR-5 molecule, and some interleukins (like IL-6, and IL-12) that may lead to abortion.\r\nObjective: To study association between TLR-5 gene polymorphisms (rs2072493) with the susceptibility to toxoplasmosis in a sample of women with miscarriage and to study the association of TLR-5 polymorphisms (rs2072493) with the serum level of TLR-5, IL-6 and IL-12. \r\nMethods: This is a case-control study was conducted on 200 women, of which, 50 pregnant women seropositive (IgG, IgM) for T. gondii (Group1), 50 pregnant women seronegative (IgG, IgM) for T. gondii (Group2) as a control group, 50 women with miscarriage seropositive (IgG, IgM) for T. gondii (Group3), and 50 women with miscarriage seronegative (IgG, IgM) for T. gondii (Group4) as a control group. They were recruited from Balad General Hospital, Salah al-Din and private laboratory in the period from January 2021 to December 2021. The serum level of TLR-5, IL-6 and IL-12 were measured. The selected single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) (rs2072493) in TLR-5 were detected by using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers.\r\nResults: The frequency of the heterozygous genotype (TC) for SNPs TLR-5 gene (rs2072493) was significantly higher in Group1 than Group2 (P=0.004). At allelic level, the frequency of mutant allele (allele C) was significantly higher in Group1 than in Group2 (p=0.009), and in Group3 than in Group4 (P=0.025). There was significant increase in serum level of TLR-5 in Group1 and in Group3. There was significant increase in serum level of IL-6 and IL-12 in Group1.\r\nConclusion: There is significant association of toxoplasmosis with mutant allele (allele C) of the SNP rs2072493, which may be considered as a risk factor for toxoplasmosis and stimulate miscarriage in pregnant women.

Studies of sociodemographic characteristics and peptic ulcers identified various risk factors, such as low salary, household member crowding, unemployment, marital strain, and psychological and physical stress.\r\nObjective: To determine the clinical picture of stress peptic ulcer in a sample of Iraqi patients. \r\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was performed in Al-Imamein Al-Khadimein Medical City, Iraq to determine the clinical features of stress peptic ulcer in a sample of Iraqi patients. Sample collection was done in a period of two years, from April 2021, to April 2023. At first, the process was explained to the patients and informed consent taken from all enrolled individuals. The diagnosis of stress peptic ulcer was done by gastroduodenoscopy, or by laparotomy for acute abdomen (perforated stress ulcer). All selected patients were tested for the presence of active H. pylori infection by stool antigen test (and it was negative). The patients were divided into two groups; Group A patients were presented as an (emergency cases) with complications of stress peptic ulcer either perforation or upper gastrointestinal bleeding stress ulcer; and Group B patients were presented with dyspepsia (as a cold cases), proved by gastroduodenoscopy to be due to stress peptic ulcer.\r\nResults: A total of 86 patients with stress ulcer, 37 (43.02%) males, and 49 (56.97%) females, their age ranged from 13-76 years (mean age 36.16±76 years). Group A were 31 (36.04%) patients, their presentations were either acute abdomen proved to be due to perforated stress ulcer by laparotomy in 8 (9.30%) patients, or hematemesis in 23 (26.74%) patients.

This injury impairs the nervous system\'s ability to transfer messages, resulting in a variety of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and psychiatric issues. Double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, and problems with sensation or coordination are all possible symptoms. MS comes in a variety of ways, with new symptoms appearing in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or gradually over time (progressive forms), the progressive forms symptoms may go away completely between attacks. The exact cause is unknown.\r\nObjective: To determine trace elements (zinc and copper) and discuss their relation and effect on MS patients.\r\nMethods: The study was performed during the period March 2021 to August 2021, involved 50 samples divided into two groups the first 25 samples from normal individuals (16 males and 9 females) and the second 25 sample of MS patients (12 males and 13 females) collected with help of (Sa\'ad Al-Watrai Hospital), (Neuroscience Hospital) in Baghdad City.

Sleep deprivation or sleep interruption differ in their effect on systolic blood pressure causing renal tissue changes that predispose to CKD. Material and Methods: A sample of thirty adult male albino Rats, and divided into three groups (10 animals per group): The control group: at normal sleep rhythm which is 12 hours in dark and 12 hours in light. Group A: at 12 hours light and 12 hours dark with the production of a flashlight at three-time intervals (2 hours apart), during their sleep period, Group B: Rats were exposed to a reduction in sleep time by continuous flashlight stimulation for 7 hours per day, during their sleep period, then kidneys were dissected and prepared for histological evaluation and quantification. Result: This study showed the effect of sleep disturbance patterns (sleep reduction, and sleep interruption) by light stimulation in adult male rats on cortical renal tubules and cortical vessels which showed prominent dilatation in cortical renal tubules with the presence of cortical hemorrhagic areas, and cortical necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration were seen associated with sleep deprivation prominently.

Studies evaluating both peripheral and central nervous system involvement in patients with COPD at the same time are rare. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assesses excitability of the motor cortex and corticospinal pathway function. Diaphragmatic contractile function had been assessed by cortical and cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve roots in COPD patients.\r\nObjective: To investigate electrophysiologically central nervous system involvement in COPD as compared to healthy controls, to study the central neural derive of the diaphragm by assessing TMS-MEP parameters of the phrenic nerve in patients with COPD and compare these with healthy controls.  \r\nMethods: The present study is a case control study was conducted in Al-Imamein Al-Kadhimein Medical City, from November 2019 to October 2021 included 40 COPD patients and 40 healthy volunteers who were subjected to blood gas and biochemical analysis and pulmonary function test before commencement of neurophysiological analysis.\r\nResults: Statistically significant prolongation of the cortical motor latencies as well as peripheral motor conduction times of both phrenic nerves in COPD patients compared to control subjects (p<0.001). The means of the central motor conduction times in the both phrenic nerves were higher in COPD patients compared to controls, yet, the difference was only significant in the right phrenic nerve. There was statistically significant increase in the means of the motor threshold of both phrenic nerve in some patients with COPD in comparison with control group. The phrenic nerve cortical latencies showed the most sensitive and specific parameters to study the involvement of nervous system in COPD, while the peripheral motor conduction time was the second most sensitive and specific parameter. No correlations observed between body mass index, SpO2 with phrenic nerves TMS parameters.\r\nConclusion: The central neuropathy is one of the complications in COPD patients. Motor threshold of phrenic nerves was significantly higher in COPD patients reflecting significant decrease in excitability of motor cortex affecting excitatory contact with subcortical neurons.

It may impact renal and hepatic function by causing a cytokine storm and inflammation. Although numerous studies on the effects of COVID-19 on people with diabetes Mellitus (DM) have been conducted across the globe, their conclusions have varied due to differences in study populations\' demographics, racial and ethnic composition, and geographic locations.\r\nObjective: To comprehend the effects of a severe COVID-19 infection on renal and hepatic function in patients with diabetes mellitus. \r\nMethods: This study was carried out at the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department of Al-Nahrain University in Baghdad, Iraq. A total of 100 participants with a severe case of COVID-19 were included in the study between February and April 2022. There was a total of 100 hospital admissions due to COVID-19; 50 of these patients had diabetes, while the other 50 did not.

By encouraging the absorption and metabolism of calcium and phosphate, vitamin D is an essential prohormone for maintaining the health of bones and muscles. A sizeable amount of the body\'s vitamin D requirements are synthesized by the human body using ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunshine in addition to dietary sources such fatty fish, eggs, fortified milk, and cod liver oil. Vitamin D is available in two different forms: D2 and D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D2 is a synthetic version that is frequently found in fortified foods and is sourced from plants, but vitamin D3 is synthesized by the skin after exposure to sunlight and may be obtained from animal sources. The main function of vitamin D is thought to be the body\'s absorption of calcium from the gut, which is essential for skeletal health (bone mineralization, remodeling, and maintenance). But hypovitaminosis D, also known as a vitamin D deficiency, can have an impact on the bones, muscles, brain, heart, and immune system, among other components of the body. As a result, the shortage causes serious illnesses like cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, infections, rickets (in children), osteopenia, osteoporosis, hypertension, fractures and falls in adults, and neurological abnormalities. A complete understanding of vitamin D sources, serum vitamin D levels, and deficient symptoms, connected to various clinical diseases, requirement and maintenance in the body, length of sun exposure, and effective treatment dose, is an effective strategy for deficiency prevention. The importance of Vitamin D, the causes of its shortage, and the sources accessible will therefore be highlighted in the current review.\r\nKeywords: Vitamin D, synthesis, levels and functions, sources, deficiency\r\nCitation: Abass HA, Omran ZS.

Spasticity is a state, in which, there is an increase in muscle tone or stiffness, which might be associated with movement and speech disorders. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to nerve pathways within the brain or spinal cord that control muscle movement. The H-reflex is a compound electromyographic (EMG) response composed of group Ia (and large group II) afferents from muscle spindles (and Golgi tendon organs) that project monosynaptically (and to a lesser extent di- and tri-synaptically) to spinal efferent α-motoneurons (αMN), which in turn activate the muscle after an electrical current is applied to the nerve.\r\nObjective: To assess the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale in post stroke spasticity patients and to estimate the neurophysiological changes in those patients regarding H-reflex and Hmax/Mmax ratio. \r\nMethods:A randomized clinical trial involves 50 patients with stroke of both sexes. Their age ranged from (30-60 years old) suffering from upper and lower limb spasticity. They were assessed by the MRC scale to determine the grade of power of muscle. The neurophysiological test is done by using the H-reflex for both upper and lower limbs (flexor carpi radialis and soleus muscles, respectively). The maximum amplitude was measured from the peak of the first positive deflection to the peak of the negative one. The latency and the Hmax/Mmax ratio were also measured.\r\nResults: The result of this study showed a significant decrease in MRC in spastic patients (P value ≤0.001). H-reflex latency in lower limbs was significantly decreased from (30.3±2.4 ms) in the normal population to (18.5±1.3) in the spastic patient. The H reflex amplitude in the lower limb was significantly increased in post stroke spasticity patients (P value ≤0.05).  In the upper limbs H-reflex latency in flexor carpi radialis was also significantly decreased. Regarding H reflex amplitude of the upper limb in the spastic patient was significantly increased. There is a noticeable increase in the H/M ratio in post stroke spasticity patient which was (0.51±0.92) with a significant P value of 0.005.\r\nConclusion: Patient with post stroke spasticity had decreased in MRC scale, while H-reflex has decreased in latency and increased in amplitude, as well as decreases in Hmax/Mmax Ratio in both upper and lower limbs.  \r\nKeywords: Post stroke spasticity, H-reflex latency, H-reflex amplitude, H/M ratio, MRC scale.\r\nCitation: Fawzi SM, Hamdan FB, Al-Gawwam GA, Jaafar IF.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the frequencies of iucA, iroN and irp2 genes in the uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates. We also analyzed the effects of siderophore genes beside iron supplements on growth rate of the isolates. Materials and Methods: Totally, 14 E. coli strains were isolated from urinary tract infections and the presence of 3 siderophore genes were analyzed using PCR among them. Results:  The frequency of iucA, iroN and irp2 genes among 14 UPEC isolates were 3(21.42%), 10(71.4%) and 4(28.6%), respectively. In addition, our findings showed that Fe (III) supplements had significantly higher promoting effects on UPEC growth rate. Conclusions: irp2 gene probably plays a major role in the pathogenesis of UPEC strains. Promoting or inhibitory effects of iron on bacterial growth mainly depend on the iron concentration in the culture medium however different siderophores have different potentials for capturing and assimilation of Fe ions by the bacteria, especially inside the host cell.

The data was gathered in December 2021, and the follow-up for each patient lasts for 6 months after the gamma knife surgery.  \r\nResults The outcomes showed that there is a decrease in meningioma volumes of 83.7% of patients. While only 2.3% of the patients recorded no change in meningioma size. Additionally, 9.3% of the patients recorded an increase in meningioma size. And finally, the tumor was completely disappeared in 4.7% of the patients. \r\nConclusions The gamma knife treatment is a beneficial option for reducing the meningioma volume. The study demonstrated that a significant majority of patients experienced a decrease in tumor size. Furthermore, a small percentage of patients reported no change or an increase in tumor size, indicating that gamma knife treatment may not be equally effective for all individuals. However, it is worth noting that two patients reported complete disappearance of their tumors, suggesting a potential for successful tumor eradication with this treatment. \r\n', '', '', '', 420, 'Stereotactic; radiosurgery; Iraq; Brain; Tumor', 0, 0, 0, '2024-03-01 19:02:02', 0, 0, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0),

Tyrosinase enzymes increase and decrease the antioxidants naturally produced in the body, leading to melasma. Tyrosinase (TYR) is a key enzyme in melanogenesis. That increased tyrosinase\'s various mechanisms and genetic, environmental, and endocrine factors.\r\nObjective: To investigate the relationship between serum TYR. enzyme levels and the severity of melasma as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment.\r\nMethods: A case–control study was executed during the term of March to October 2023; a research investigation has been carried out. (60) patients with melasma and (60) control completed the study (120 females), with an age range of (20-50) years. All participants were examined using Wood\'s light.  Blood samples were collected from each individual, and sera were used after separation to measure TYR by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method levels in different stages of melasma severity. \r\nResults: A total 120 samples from melasma women found a significantly increased concentration TYR. with different stages of severity (7.36±0.19 U/ml) compared to the control (3.89±0.08 U/ml) utilizing an independent t-test. Additionally, serum TYR. levels increased significantly as melasma severity increased. Furthermore, the one-way ANOVA test indicated substantial serum TYR MASI levels score for mild, moderate, and severe were 6.19±0.1U/ml, 7.69±0.07 U/ml, and 9.38±0.31 U/ml, respectively.

The goal of this hypothesis is to propose that COVID-19 may interfere with the glycolytic pathway by changing the amounts of intracellular metabolites, especially 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), to aid in the release of oxygen from hemoglobin into the tissues, therefore preventing or treating hypoxia.\r\nAs a conclusion, focusing on hypoxia as the primary cause of severe morbidity in COVID-19 patients is thought to result from an increased stability of the relax (R-form) of hemoglobin at the tissue level due to a decrease in glucose metabolite produced from glycolysis process in RBCs (decrease 2,3-BPG concentration in the blood).

Healthy brain tissue often surrounds the target when therapies are delivered inside the skull, and this is usually the main organ that is at risk (OAR). To reduce the possibility of normal tissue toxicity and its associated side effects, it is imperative to establish a steep dosage falloff from the target\'s periphery to normal tissue when using these kinds of treatments.\r\nObjective: To evaluate the plans of vestibular Schwannoma using the latest version of gamma knife “lightning by estimating the correlation between the overall sphericity degree and, most important the evaluation parameters such as coverage, selectivity, homogeneity index (HI), selectivity, gradient index (????I), and shot density. \r\nMethods: A cross-sectional study. The sphericity degree (φ) was determined by using planning for each target volume (TV) of the fifty patients who had stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) performed on them in order to treat vestibular schwannoma, Calculating this parameter required developing a theoretical concept for operational sphericity, which was done and following are some of the measurements that are used in the analysis of the values that were found: coverage (????), selectivity (S), gradient index (????I), Paddick conformity index (????I Paddick), and dosage distribution (IV/TV).\r\nResults: The mean age of patients was 44.54±11.93 years ranging from (20-80) years and the prevalence of females in this study was 35 (70%) more than the males 15 (30%). The prescribed dose for vestibular Schwannoma patients was 12????y. The mean target volume is 5.367±0.058 cm3, ranging from (0.079-26.497) cm3. This study showed that dividing the tumor into 2 spheres, the first sphere delineates the regular part of the tumor, and the second sphere is delineated irregular cancer components, since the reference plan is a spherical target, the degree of sphericity is an excellent parameter to use when evaluating the dose distribution of a plan for the treatment of vestibular Schwannoma.\r\nConclusion: According to the findings of this study, dividing the tumor into two spheres provides valuable information regarding the dose distribution both inside and outside the desired volume. \r\nKeywords: Stereotactic radiosurgery, Acoustic neuromas, gradient index, selectivity, coverage\r\nCitation: Jasim MH, Abdullah SS, Faraj MK.

The N13 and P14 latencies exhibited the highest sensitivity and specificity.\r\nConclusion: SEPs are more sensitive in identifying mild posterior column dysfunction in patients with cervical radiculopathy, which is at least imperceptible on routine NCS. SEP testing is an essential adjunctive diagnostic method for evaluating the spinal cord and nerve roots electrophysiologically. The N13 and P14 components have the highest sensitivity and specificity when comparing the patient and control groups. \r\nKeywords: Cervical radiculopathy, NCS, EMG, SEP\r\nCitation: Kaddoori HG.

Clinical microbiology labs deal with many cases of UTI, and the most common cause of UTI is still enteric bacteria, namely Escherichia coli (E. coli).\r\nObjective: To isolate and identify E. coli in urine and determine their connection to antibiotic resistance. \r\nMethods: A consultant doctor from many hospitals oversaw the patients and a nurse was collected of 100 urine samples from patients suffering from UTI. Due to the large number of E. coli isolates (50 in total) and the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for molecular detection of the diagnostic element 16SrRNA, the conventional techniques of bacterial identification were verified before PCR.\r\nResults: A total of 50 (50%) of the bacterial isolates were determined to be E. coli after culturing, biochemical, and molecular testing. E. coli was shown to be multidrug resistant (MDR) after an antibiotic susceptibility test. Assessment of antibiotic resistance was done on 25 isolates, and revealed that one (4%) is resistant to Nitrofurantoin, seven (28%) to Gentamicin, fifteen (60%) to Ciprofloxacin, and sixteen (64%) to Tetracycline. A total of 24 (96%) bacterial isolates are Carbenicillin-resistant; 18 (72%) of these isolates are resistant to Novobiocin, 20 (80%) to Cefotaxime, 22 (88%) to Ceftazidime, 23 (92%) to Rifampin, and 24 (96%) to Carbenicillin. Based on PCR results, all E. coli bacteria had the diagnostic gene 16SrRNA.\r\nConclusion: This study found that nitrofurantoin is the antibiotic of choice for treating E. coli UTI, and the 16SrRNA gene is a confirmative diagnostic gene for E. coli infection.\r\nKeywords: E. coli, antibiotics, multidrug resistance, 16SrRNA\r\nCitation: Abbood SA.

It is the most common emergency encountered by otolaryngologists. It affects all age groups and both genders. Several different modalities can be used to control nose bleeds.\r\nObjective: To study the association of different health conditions with epistaxis, effectiveness of emergency interventions to control it, and the outcome of each approach.\r\nMethods: One hundred eighteen patients with epistaxis were selected during the period of one year. Examination was done for all patients after securing the airway to determine the site of bleeding followed by the proper management. Different managements were studied for efficacy and outcome.\r\nResults: The mean age for epistaxis was 53.81 years with 71.2% of patients being older than 45 years, male to female ratio was 1.68:1. There was a strong association between the incidence of epistaxis and increasing age (P = 0.002) with male predominance. The anterior septum was the most implicated area in epistaxis (58%). The most commonly encountered intranasal pathology was a deviated nasal septum (25.4%). The most commonly associated systemic disease with epistaxis was hypertension (43%). Forty one percent of the patients were on anticoagulants. Collectively, only 25.4% of epistaxis were idiopathic in nature. The most commonly used intervention to stop the bleeding was silver nitrates cauterization (45%). Ninety two percent of the patients underwent a non-surgical method to stop the bleeding, and 78% underwent a direct approach. Most failures were observed in endoscopic assisted cauterization (41.6%). Seventy five percent were treated in an outpatient setting, while the rest were hospitalized. The use of a direct approach for epistaxis management was associated with significantly lower hospitalizations (P <0.001).\r\nConclusion: Epistaxis affects adults in all age groups and incidence increases with age.

The ovary is made up of two layers; the outer layer, known as the cortex and the medulla is the inner layer. E-cadherin is a single-span transmembrane glycoprotein with five repetitions and a cytoplasmic domain. It plays a variety of roles, including ensuring tissue integrity and resistance to stretching, cell signaling, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival, and carcinogenesis.\r\nObjective: To assess E-cadherin level as predicting parameter for ovarian reserve. \r\nMethods: Female\'s rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of age (10 to more than 108 weeks), weighting 600-3000 grams were randomized into two groups: group A (25 sample, young group), group B (25 sample, old group). All groups\' animals prior to euthanasia, blood was collected from the heart for assessment of plasma level of E-cadherin and then euthanized the animals. Specimens of ovaries were placed on standard glass slides for Hematoxylin and Eosin stain for demonstration of the cellular components of the ovary and follicles at various developmental stages.\r\nResults: The current study showed significant differences of plasma E-cadherin levels (P = 0.003), primordial follicles count (P <0.001) and antral follicles count (p<0.001); however, there was no significant difference of ovarian weight (P = 0.457) between group A and group B right ovaries respectively. Comparisons between group A and group B left ovaries were also showed significant differences of plasma E-cadherin levels (P = 0.003), primordial follicles count (P < 0.001), antral follicles count (P <0.001) in addition to ovarian weight (P <0.001). There were significant differences (P <0.05) of primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles count between group A and group B both right and left ovaries.\r\nConclusion: E-cadherin plasma level is negatively correlated with animal age and ovarian weight.

The cause of DPN is still a subject of controversy, but it is possible that proinflammatory cytokine mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) play a role.\r\nObjective: To assess the correlation between pro-inflammatory marker (Il-6) and the development of DPN in T2DM patients. \r\nMethods: A case-control study, involved randomly selected 140 T2DM patients attended to Al-Numan Teaching Hospital at Baghdad during the period from October 2023 to January 2024. Their age ranged from 25 to 80 years, 57 males and 83 females. The patients have been divided into two groups; those with DPN and diabetic patients without neuropathy. For both groups\' patients, whole blood sample was centrifuged and serum was prepared and used as biological material for IL-6 levels determination by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. This study compared IL-6 levels between the two groups.\r\nResults: The mean age of study samples was 58.69±10.51 years. The female to male ratio 1.45:1, as well as females were dominant among cases and that of controls group, but such differences were not statistically significant. The mean value of IL-6 was found to be significantly higher among cases group than that of controls group (117.68±27.38 vs. 57.3±13.24 pg/ml) respectively. The optimal cutoff value of IL-6 for detection of diabetic patients with high risk of neuropathy development was 72.46 pg/ml with sensitivity of 97.1%, and specificity of 87.1% with good area under the ROC curve (AUC) (P <0.001). The mean level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly higher among cases group than that of controls group (8.27±1.92 vs. 7.19±1.61) %.\r\nConclusion: Current study concluded that IL-6 is significantly elevated levels in T2DM patients with DPN, the proinflammatory cytokine could be used as a useful indicator for development of DPN. \r\nKeywords: Diabetic neuropathy, IL-6, type 2 diabetes mellitus\r\nCitation: Abdulrhaman DM, Khalil NS, Fahad HM.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause cervical cancer in women, but its association with male infertility is gaining attention. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection has been linked to oxidative stress (OS), an imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body. This OS may impact sperm function and fertility in men.\r\nObjective: To find out the association of ROS with HR-HPV infection and sperm parameters with group of infertile Iraqi patients with unknown causes. \r\nMethods: A case-control study of 68 seminal fluid samples (34 fertile and 34 infertile males) submitted to real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of HR-HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68) and the plasma of seminal fluid samples were tested for ROS by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\r\nResults: The outcomes showed high statistically significant association of ROS level with sperm parameters and HR-HPV infection (P <0.001), twenty-nine (42.6%) of infertile men were with high level of ROS. Twenty-five (36.8%) of asthenozoospermia samples were had high ROS levels, while only 4 (5.9%) samples had low level of ROS. The abnormal sperm morphology was found in 34 (50%) of samples, 29 (42.6%) and 5 (7.4%) of them were with high and low levels of ROS, respectively. Furthermore, 17 of positive HR-HPV samples were showed 16 (23.5%) with high level of ROS.\r\nConclusion: HR-HPV infection may cause elevated level of ROS, and this may potentially affect sperm parameters in idiopathic infertile males. \r\nKeywords: High risk human papillomavirus, idiopathic infertility, sperm parameter, reactive oxygen species\r\nCitation: Dawood MA, Al-Shuwaikh AM, Al-Kawaz UM.

The thickness of the gingiva measured before extractions. The patients were then divided into two groups: control group, filled with xenograft only and the study group, where in 16 extraction sockets were filled with xenograft and PTH. Gingival thickness was remeasured after 4 months of treatment. \r\nResults: All the extraction sites were characterized by spontaneous healing.

These consequences, which include neuropsychiatric symptoms, respiratory issues, chronic fatigue, and circulatory abnormalities, provide significant challenges to healthcare systems all over the world. Because the conventional medical treatments that are now available are unable to provide total comfort, there has been a growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine practices. There has been a lot of interest in herbal treatments because of the possibility that they may be utilized to treat these complex post-viral disorders. Traditional medicine has employed herbs for centuries. The therapeutic properties of medicinal plants are examined in this study. Particular attention is paid to the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antiviral activities of medicinal plants. These plants contain bioactive molecules that have the potential to give a number of benefits. The long-term consequences of COVID-19 can be minimized by utilizing these compounds\' capacity to suppress chronic inflammation, control immunological responses, and prevent oxidative damage. Looks like medicinal plants might help COVID-19 patients live longer and recover from their condition more quickly, according to promising results from early clinical and preclinical trials. These findings need to be confirmed by further clinical and mechanistic investigations to guarantee that medicinal plants are safe and effective. A comprehensive medical strategy that addresses patients\' requirements following COVID-19 is highlighted by this study. Evidence-based medicinal herbs should be used with conventional therapy.

This review synthesizes current knowledge on the roles of A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteases and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the progression and immune modulation of CRC. ADAM proteases contribute to the shedding of immune-stimulatory molecules, aiding tumor cells in evading immune detection, while miRNAs serve as critical regulators of various oncogenic pathways, including those controlling protease activity. Together, ADAM proteases and miRNAs are involved in reshaping the immune landscape of CRC, influencing tumor immunogenicity and response to therapies. We explore the mechanisms by which ADAM proteases and miRNAs facilitate CRC immune evasion, their potential as biomarkers for early detection, and their promise as therapeutic targets to counteract immune escape and improve patient outcomes.
